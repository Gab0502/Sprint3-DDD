# Sprint 3 - Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Project

## Overview
This project represents a Sprint 3 implementation following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. The project is built using Java and is configured with Maven for dependency management and project build.

## Project Structure
- **.idea/**: Contains IDE-related files and settings for IntelliJ IDEA.
- **pom.xml**: Maven configuration file, used to manage dependencies, build settings, and plugins.
- **src/**: The source code directory, containing the main Java code and resources.
- **target/**: This directory contains the compiled classes and the final artifacts generated by Maven.

## Prerequisites
- **Java JDK 8+**: Ensure you have Java installed. You can download it from [Oracle's official site](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- **Maven**: Apache Maven is required to build and manage the project. You can install Maven from [here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA is recommended for managing and editing the project, as it already includes configuration files for this IDE.

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Sprint3-DDD/sprint3
   ```
3. **Build the project with Maven**:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
4. **Run the application**:
   After successfully building the project, you can run the application using your IDE or by executing the following command:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

## Development
- The codebase follows Domain-Driven Design principles.
- Ensure that your Java classes are structured to separate concerns, such as entities, repositories, services, and controllers.
